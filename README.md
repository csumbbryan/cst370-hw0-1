# CST370-HW0_1 in Java
Write a Java program for hw0_1 that reads two integer numbers and displays the sum and difference (absolute) of the two numbers. Note the difference is "absolute" and should always be positive (including 0)

Sample Run 0: This is a sample run of the program. The first line are the input numbers: 9 and -10. The second line is your output for the sum, and the third line is your output for the differnce:

9 -10
SUM:-1
DIFF:19

Sample Run 1: This is another sample run.

12 5
SUM:17
DIFF:7

Sample Run 2: This is another sample run.

-7 -7
SUM:-14
DIFF:0
